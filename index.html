	<h1>There are two types of length units: absolute and relative.</h1>
	<h2>It is very important to distinguish between absolute and relative length values.</h2> 
	<h3>The absolute length units are fixed and a length expressed in any of these will appear as exactly that size.
Absolute length units are not recommended for use on screen, because screen sizes vary so much. However, they can be used if the output medium is known, such as for print layout.</h3>
		<h4>Relative Length
		 units specify a length relative to another length property. Relative length units scale better between different rendering medium.</h4>
		<!--Absolute is fixed,Relative is fluid or calculated in relation with the other elements-->
		 <p>The absolute units always indicate a fixed length, while with the relative units the length is always calculated in relation to other elements.</p>
		 <p>The units in which length is measured can be either absolute such as pixels, points and so on, or relative such as percentages (%) and em units.</p>
<ul>
